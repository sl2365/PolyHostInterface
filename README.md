# Poly Host Interface

A lightweight, tabbed VST3 / CLAP plugin host for Windows.
Play synths and route FX chains, driven by any MIDI device.
Fully portable: stores all settings next to the exe, touches nothing else on the system.

I always liked tools like TobyBear's MiniHost, SaviHost and Tone2's NanoHost. But wanted something that combines all of them. A quick jamming tool that can open multiple plugin formats. I aim to add support for more formats, but the main ones will most likely be tried first at least. This is a tool that doesn't yet exist elsewhere in a small package like this, at least not as one that you can use file-associations with.

## Build Setup (one-time)

### 1. Visual Studio 2022 Community (free)
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
During install tick: Desktop development with C++
You never open Visual Studio. It only provides the C++ compiler that CMake calls.
But this way allows you to use whatever editor you want.

### 2. Portable CMake (no installer)
Download the Windows x64 ZIP from: https://cmake.org/download/
Extract so the result is: tools\cmake\bin\cmake.exe

### 3. Build
Double-click build.bat from the project root.
First run downloads JUCE automatically (needs internet).
After that, builds are fully offline.
The finished exe appears in dist\PolyHost.exe

## Opening a Plugin

1. Right-click any .vst2, .vst3 or .clap file in File Explorer
2. Open with > Choose another app
3. Browse to PolyHost.exe
4. Tick "Always use this app" if you want it permanent

## VST2 Support

If you have a copy of vstsdk2.4, place it here: {CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/vstsdk2.4
then run build.bat.

## CLAP Support

Download clap-main here: https://github.com/free-audio/clap
Install to tools/clap/CMakeLists.txt

## Audio Routing

    MIDI Device
         |
    [Synth Tab 1] --+
    [Synth Tab 2] --+  (summed)
                    |
              [FX Tab 1]
                    |
              [FX Tab 2]  ...
                    |
              [Audio Out]

The synths always wired in parallel. FX are in series and routing can be modified by entering the Routing page. Click the Routing toolbar button and a list of all tabs appears, use Up and Down buttons to manage the processing order.
